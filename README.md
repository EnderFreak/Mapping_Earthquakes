# Purpose of repository

This module will use the Leaflet.js API to create an Earthquake map using layers from a geographical map of the Earth. Each earthquake icon is represented by a circle of varying colours (yellow, red, etc.) where each colour represents the magnitude (yellow - smaller, red - larger, etc.). Using a popup market; when clicked, information about the magnitude and location of the earthquake will be shown to the user.
